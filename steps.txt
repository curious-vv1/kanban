Step 1: Project Setup and Initial Structure
Create a new React project using Create React App
Plan your component hierarchy:
App (main component)
Navbar (for display button and grouping/sorting options)
KanbanBoard (main board container)
Column (for each group of tickets)
Card (for individual tickets)
Step 2: State Management
Create necessary states in App.js:
Create a function to fetch data from the API using useEffect
Step 3: Display Button and Dropdown
Create a Navbar component with:
Display button that shows/hides grouping options
Dropdown menu for grouping options (Status/User/Priority)
Dropdown menu for sorting options (Priority/Title)
Style it to match the design
Save selected options to localStorage
Step 4: Data Processing Functions
Create utility functions to:
Group tickets based on selected option:
By Status: Create groups for each status
By User: Group tickets by user.id
By Priority: Create 5 groups (0-4)
Sort tickets within each group:
By Priority: Sort using priority numbers
By Title: Sort alphabetically
Step 5: Kanban Board Implementation
Create KanbanBoard component that:
Receives grouped/sorted data
Renders Column components
Create Column component that:
Shows column header with count
Renders Card components
Handles column-specific styling
Create Card component that:
Displays ticket information
Shows user avatar, priority, status
Matches the design
Step 6: Styling
Create separate CSS files for each component
Style components to match the design:
Use appropriate colors and spacing
Add icons for priority levels
Style user avatars
Add hover effects
Make it responsive
Step 7: Local Storage Implementation
Save user preferences:
2. Load saved preferences on page load
Update localStorage when options change
Step 8: Additional Features
Add loading states while fetching data
Implement error handling
Add responsive design for mobile devices
Add animations for smooth transitions
Key Points to Remember:
Use appropriate React hooks:
useState for state management
useEffect for API calls and side effects
useRef if needed for DOM references
Keep components modular and reusable
Follow proper naming conventions
Use CSS BEM methodology for better organization
Add comments for complex logic
Handle edge cases and loading states
